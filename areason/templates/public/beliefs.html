<h1>The following comprise our Scriptural beliefs:</h1>

<h2>The Bible</h2>
<p>We believe the Bible to be the very words of God, and it is the sole authority by which the human race should live (faith and practice). The Bible consists of sixty-six books in the Old Testament and New Testament. God breathed His words in the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek languages, and the Bible has been perfectly preserved unto our generation, fulfilling God’s promise. The official translation that shall be used by A Reason For Living shall be the King James Bible. (Psalm 12:6-7; Matthew 5:18; 2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:19-20; Psalm 119:89)</p>

<h2>The Godhead</h2>
<p>We believe in the one true God that exists in three persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit (which we call the trinity). These three are co-eternal in being and in nature with distinct personalities yet all one. (Deuteronomy 6:4; Genesis 1:1-2, 26; 1 John 5:7)</p>

<h2>The Lord Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>We believe in the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, that He was born of a virgin and conceived by the Holy Spirit. We believe that He lived a perfect and sinless life and that His purpose of birth was so that He could voluntarily shed His blood for the sins of the whole world. This was accomplished at Calvary. In addition to His death, we believe that Jesus Christ rose bodily from the grave three days later, and ascended up to heaven to sit at the right hand of the Father until the appointed time when He comes for His church. (John 1:1, 12, 14; 3:16; Matthew 28:5-6; 1 Thessalonians 4:13, 16-18)</p>

<h2>The Person of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>We believe that the Holy Spirit is the Comforter that was sent to convict the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment, and to reveal truth to all men. Through the work of the Holy Spirit men are led to Christ unto salvation, and it is the work of the Holy Spirit to seal the believer unto the day of redemption. (John 16:7-11; 14:16; Romans 8:14; Ephesians 4:30)</p>

<h2>Salvation</h2>
<p>We believe that Jesus Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures and that He was buried and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures (I Corinthians 15:3-4). The only way to go to heaven is by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ that you are saved by grace through faith – nothing else, no works, but by grace alone. We believe that salvation is the deliverance from the eternal judgment of the lake of fire. This deliverance is done by the complete and finished work of Christ at the cross where He shed His blood for the sins of the whole world and whosoever believeth in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. (John 3:16; Romans 10:9; Hebrews 5:1-11)</p>

<h2>Eternal Security of the Believer</h2>
<p>We believe that the salvation given by Christ is eternal and cannot be broken. Once you have believed on Jesus Christ as your Savior, you are sealed unto the day of redemption. Since it is not by works one receives salvation, then it is not by works one can lose salvation. Christ saves you and keeps you forever and ever. (John 10:27-30; Ephesians 4:30)</p>

<h2>The Church</h2>
<p>We believe in the one true church, which is made up of people who have accepted Jesus Christ as Savior from Pentecost to the Rapture, also known as the Bride of Christ. The local church is a gathering of fellow believers in a community coming together for the purpose of worship, fellowship, and to be instructed in the Word of God. (1 Corinthians 12:13; Ephesians 5:22-32, Acts 2:42-47). The two offices that are mentioned in scripture are the pastor and deacon, which shall be the elders of the church. The pastor is the shepherd of the flock, and he is the overseer of the congregation. His purpose is to protect, teach, and love the people of his assembly. The pastor must also meet and follow written qualifications to be in the ministry. (I Timothy 3:1-7; Titus 1:6-9) The deacon is a servant who ministers to the church by helping the widows and assisting the pastor in any way needed. He too must meet and follow written qualifications to be in this position. (I Timothy 3:8-13)</p>

<h2>Ordinances of the Church</h2>
<p>We believe that the only two ordinances instructed to the New Testament church are the baptism of the believer by immersion (which does not give salvation but is an outward showing of their inward faith) and the Lord’s Supper (which is for a remembrance of the work Christ did for us at Calvary). (Acts 8:36-39; 1 Peter 3:21; 1 Corinthians 11:23-29; Mark 14:22-25)</p>

<h2>Second Coming of Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>We believe that Jesus Christ will come again and bring judgment and wrath upon those that dwell upon the earth. Those judgments are described in detail in the book of Revelation. But before God’s wrath is poured out, the Lord will snatch his Bride (the church) from this earth. This event is known as the rapture and so shall we ever be with the Lord. As believers we will stand before the Bema seat of Christ where our works shall be tried by fire and rewards will be given to the believer. At the end of the tribulation, Jesus will return to set up His kingdom and bind Satan for one thousand years. At the end of the thousand years Satan will be loosed for a little season where God will defeat him and his followers for the last time. Then all the unbelievers shall stand before the Great White Throne and be judged out of the book of life and cast into the lake of fire – this is the second death. After this God will create a new heaven, new earth, and new Jerusalem where we will dwell forever. (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18; Titus 2:13; Matthew 24:4-31; Revelation 19:11-16; 20:1-6; 21:1-8)</p>
